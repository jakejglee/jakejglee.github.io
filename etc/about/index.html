  <h2>About Jake</h2>
  <div class="profile">
  <img src="/imgs/jake_looking-forward.jpg">
  <p>Jake Lee [he/him] wants to protect the redwood forests. He is an engineer, maker, artist, and aspiring farmer. Knowledge is powerful, but so is convenience. He is frustrated by the current agricultural system in America (and globally). Equal access to education for all people is important to him. Jake hopes to some day combine all of his frustrations with his interest in robotics to build tools that can simultaneously help small farmers and provide engineering education to rural communities.</p>
  <p>Jake graduated from the Jack Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz in 2017 with a B.S. Electrical Engineering degree with a minor in Computer Engineering. As an undergraduate, Jake discovered his passion for engineering design. He is passionate about learning and designing things. During the coronavirus pandemic of 2020, Jake has spent his abundant free time developing "smart" gardening tech and volunteering at the <a href="https://www.spadeandplow.com/">Spade and Plow</a> farm in San Martin.</p>
  <p>Please contact Jake if you are interested in learning more about any of his projects and thanks for stopping by!</p>
