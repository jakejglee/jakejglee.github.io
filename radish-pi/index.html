  <h2>background</h2>
  <p>
  After Harry Jackson, Lon Blauvelt, and I graduated from college in 2017, we 
  decided to spend our last summer in Santa Cruz building something cool. None 
  of us liked spending money on fresh beets, so we wondered: how hard would it 
  be to grow some superior beets? Everyone knows that the freshest beets are 
  dirt-free, so we started researching hydroponic methods and when we learned 
  how efficient aeroponics systems could be, we saw into the future of beets. 
  We saw pH sensors and control frameworks that could automatically tweak the 
  nutrient content of our mist; optimization, efficiency, and, best of all, 
  lots of beets. However, after tasting a poorly-pickled beet, Lon became 
  disillusioned with beets altogether. In order to keep our team intact, we 
  compromised to grow fresh radishes, and the radish-pi project was born.
  </p>
  <p>
  For context, aeroponics is a type of 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroponics">hydroponics</a> in which 
  the roots of plants are directly and continuously coated in a nutrient-rich 
  mist. Two main forms of aeroponics exist: high-pressure aeroponics (HPA) and 
  low-pressure aeroponics (LPA). Both types of aeroponics are more efficient than 
  other forms of hydroponics, but typically HPA is more expensive than LPA.
  </p>
  <p>
  As a permaculture enthusiast, my mantra is to "work with nature" as 
  much as possible, but aeroponics requires one to almost <i>fully replace</i> 
  nature. From seed to harvest, the plant needs to be kept in as sterile of an 
  environment as possible. That means between harvesting and planting a new crop, 
  the enclosure needs to be deep-bleached. If any pest or disease finds its way 
  into an aeroponics system, the entire crop can be ruined, even with quick 
  action to isolate affected plants. Also, if the roots of plants become dry for 
  any amount of time, they will die. Frequently, the nutrient solution causes 
  sprayers to clog.
  </p>
  <p>
  For all the challenges posed by aeroponics, it is the most efficient way to 
  grow a plant that we know of. HPA has been observed to decrease time needed 
  from seed to harvest by 
  <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17429145.2018.1472308">45%</a>. 
  These systems are also as nutrient and water efficient as could be imagined 
  since they are essentially closed systems where water and nutrients are 
  collected and pumped back into the misters. Since HPA gives roots a perfect 
  balance of oxygen, water, and nutrients, plants in these systems become 
  extremely nutrient dense and very big, very quickly. With the Tumor of Urban 
  Sprawl, the Horrors of Industrial Agriculture, and all the perks of aeroponics, 
  we decided it was worth looking into this project.
  </p>
  <p>
  Today, radish-pi lives on with its original team. After that summer, we had 
  a plan, all the necessary parts, and a vision, and we were integrating and 
  testing before we each had to find jobs. Then work stopped completely... 
  for a while. Somehow we found our way back to each other during the 
  coronavirus pandemic in 2020, and we are working with renewed gusto to 
  finish and finally produce those freshest of be-err, radishes that we first 
  dreamed of three years before.
  </p>
  <h2>break it down</h2>
  <h3>pump system</h3>
  <p>
  A convention with HPA is to keep mist droplet size between 30um-100um in diameter. 
  We read that a 100psi pump connected to 0.0.25in orifice diameter jet spray 
  nozzles should produce droplets between 5um-50um in diameter.
  </p>
  <p>
  Each plant is kept in a personal "10gal" bucket with a pair of misters connected 
  in series as a fail-safe in case one mister becomes clogged. The bottom of each 
  bucket is removed and jagged "legs" are carved into the bucket to allow for water 
  drainage. Each bucket hosting the same species is then placed into the main 
  reservoir where the nutrient solution is both monitored and mixed. This solution 
  is pumped as input for the misters.

  </ul>
  <h3>sensors</h3>
  <p>
  We need to control nutrient balance, ambient temperature, light levels, and 
  root moisture. Each of these parameters is monitored by a sensor array hooked up 
  to a Raspberry Pi 3.
  </p>
  <p>
  Nutrient concentration can be inferred through solution pH and EC (salt content). 
  We handle pH measurements using a lab-grade pH probe that is communicated with 
  over I<sup>2</sup>C. We have not yet picked an EC probe, but we hope that the pH 
  meter will be sufficient to predict nutrient levels for now.
  </p>
  <p>
  Ambient temperature is monitored by another I<sup>2</sup>C sensor. The 
  <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2857">Adafruit Sensirion SHT31-D</a> 
  gives us temperature within 0.3&#176;C, plus humidity for free!
  </p>
  <p>
  To sense light levels, we are testing using generic ambient light sensors with 
  the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1085">ADS1115</a> ADC. This will 
  suffice for making sure that the roots are protected from too much light.
  </p>
  <p>
  The brains of this aeroponics system is a 
  <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/">Raspberry Pi 3 Model B</a>.
  Right now it relies on <a href="sableye">sableye</a> for sensor data streams, 
  but our vision is to implement ROS. A Pi-camera records stills on a 24-hour 
  rollover to help us either identify any unforeseen issues or ogle at our radishes.

  injection pump, grow lights, and mister flow.
