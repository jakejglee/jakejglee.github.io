		<h3>Why do we need a gardening robot today?</h3>
<h4>1. Save money.</h4>
<p>
While it is hard to make sweeping claims about <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjhoYDMrozqAhWDITQIHQcrD_sQFjAAegQIARAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fageconsearch.umn.edu%2Frecord%2F161355%2Ffiles%2Ferr160.pdf&usg=AOvVaw3aGrHc-EhdToALuGvJjfkt">how transportation costs affect fresh fruit and vegetable prices</a>, it is safe to say that one could theoretically save money on fuel by sourcing certain produce locally. Shipping challenges <a href="https://www.logmore.com/post/the-challenges-of-fresh-produce-logistics">also lead to 33% of food being lost or wasted during the shipping process</a>.
</p>
<p>
So maybe buying food from a grocer is not incredibly efficient, but it is undoubtably convenient and reliable. Growing your own food comes with its own price tag: fertilizer, pesticide, herbicide, seeds, tools, and even water combined can make gardening a pricey hobby. Farming is also (traditionally) a lot of work, and hiring a gardener is a whole other can of $moo-lah$ to open.
</p>
<p>
A gardener robot should aim to save money on all of the above by advising human gardeners on their applications in a garden. korok maps a garden and processes data from its sensor array to provide a user with recommendations about garden planning and maintenance.
</p>
<h4>2. Keep it fresh.</h4>
<p>
Based on the <a href="https://www.logmore.com/post/the-challenges-of-fresh-produce-logistics">afformentioned article</a>, food often spends half of its shelf life being transported. Heirloom tomatoes are a good example of something that cannot be transported effectively/efficiently without being damaged. 
</p>
<p>
The freshest produce is picked right off the plant, so korok provides a user with harvest predictions and recommendations.
</p>
<h4>3. Learn more about gardening.</h4>
<p>
A yard is just as good at growing food as any farmland. Reducing our dependency on external farms means reducing carbon emissions from fuel with the added bonus of fixing atmospheric carbon dioxide. korok does not do the gardening for you, but it empowers users to get their hands dirty with confidence. This project was started as a platform to promote sustainability and robotics education, so users will learn about and be recommended sustainable/permaculture gardening solutions as well as conventional solutions, each paired with long-term efficacy models.

These drones aim to use the most affordable electronic components possible and 3D-printable mechanical components for easy part replacement. There is a lot of work left to do, but this 'bot is built on top of the <a href="sableye.html">sableye</a> data collection framework with sensors connected through a <a href="mawile.html">mawile</a> sensor interface board.
